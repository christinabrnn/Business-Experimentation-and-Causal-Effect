## Exploring the Effect of Motivational Quotes on Motivation

This project investigates whether receiving a daily motivational quote via email influences self-reported motivation levels at the end of the day.  Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we measured the causal effect of motivational messaging compared to a control condition that received only neutral facts.

### Research Question  

Does receiving a daily motivational quote via email increase self-reported motivation at the end of the day?

Hypothesis:
	•	H₀ (Null Hypothesis): There is no difference in motivation scores between those who receive a motivational quote and those who do not.
	•	H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis): Receiving a motivational quote increases motivation levels compared to the control group.
